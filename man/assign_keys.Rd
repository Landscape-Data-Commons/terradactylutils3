\usage{
assign_keys(path_project, format, non_numeric_tables)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_project}{folder in path_parent where data for preparation are stored where path_parent is the path where dima exports file for project is stored and where export files (tall, for ingest and QC files) will be stored}

\item{format}{the format that your tblPlots FormDate is in}

\item{non_numeric_tables}{tables without numeric data in a list}
}
\value{
R data with PrimaryKey, LineKey, PlotKey and RecKey assigned to each plot as well as R data with QC information about PrimaryKey assignment
}
\description{
Assigns all of the keys (primarykey, reckey, linekey, dbkey) to the DIMA tables. When using, ensure that the files are structured in the path_project folder with a file titled by the project/file(s) titled with the name of the location within that project and _ date data were received with format %Y-%m-%d/all the files exported from DIMA with the typical DIMA export naming such as tblGapHeader for instance, my file structure could be NWERN/HAFB_10062025/tbl...csv. path_qc, DIMATables, path_tall,path_original_files must be objects saved to your environment that are the file paths where outputs will be stored
